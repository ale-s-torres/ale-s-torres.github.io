My journey into the world of education began in high school when I took on a social project aimed at teaching adults who were illiterate. Meeting these individuals allowed me to see through their eyes the daily challenges and limitations faced in a world where the ability to read and write is often taken for granted. This experience profoundly impacted me, unveiling the beauty and critical importance of education in every human's life. This revelation was the primary reason I chose to pursue my degree.

In 2008, I embarked on my undergraduate studies in Early Childhood Education at the Benem√©rita y Centenaria Escuela Normal Oficial de Guanajuato. Over the course of four years, I had the opportunity to engage in practical training across various communities and neighborhoods in the city of Guanajuato. These experiences awakened a deep awareness in me about how access to education can make significant social and economic differences in a person's life.
