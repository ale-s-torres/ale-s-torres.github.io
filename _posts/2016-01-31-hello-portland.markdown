My educational journey commenced during my high school years when I volunteered to participate in an initiative aimed at promoting adult literacy. Working closely with adults who couldn't read or write, I gained insight into the challenges they faced in a literate world. This experience was eye-opening, highlighting the critical importance of education in every individual's life and steering me towards my career path.

In 2008, I embarked on a journey in Early Childhood Education at the Benem√©rita y Centenaria Escuela Normal Oficial de Guanajuato. Over these four years, I gained invaluable practical experience in various Guanajuato communities, enhancing my understanding of education's role in shaping social and economic futures. A pivotal experience was my assignment in Calderones, Gto., a remote mountain community accessible only by a perilous dirt road. Despite the challenges of a twice-daily, risky commute on public transport, I was driven by my encounters with resource-deprived schools and the stark need for dedicated educators. This motivated me to commit myself to serving those in the greatest need.

After completing my undergrad studies in Early Childhool Education, I moved to Texas in 2013 with a visa that heavily restricted me from working or studying. However, eager to continue learning about early childhood education, I volunteered for a summer school program at an elementary school. My role involved reading books to kindergarten classes. It was during this time that I met a bilingual mathematics specialist who offered me the opportunity to volunteer in her class in the fall semester. There, I worked with small groups of Spanish-speaking kindergarten students struggling with math, tailoring activities to their learning needs to reinforce classroom lessons.

The 2014-2015 academic year brought another opportunity to volunteer, this time at an elementary school in Palo Alto, California. I assisted in three kindergarten classes, one first-grade class, and a second-grade class, all of which were Spanish immersion classes. Additionally, I supervised the playground during recess and accompanied two first-grade and two second-grade classes during their lunchtime. In the 2015-2016 school year, I continued as an assistant in a first-grade class and maintained my supervisory role during recess and lunch.

I am commited to enhancing educational opportunities, particularly for communities facing social and economic challenges. My journey from a high school project to volunteering in various educational settings in the United States underscores my passion for and commitment to the field of education.
