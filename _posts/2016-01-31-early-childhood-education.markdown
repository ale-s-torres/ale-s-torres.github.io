My educational journey commenced during my high school years when I volunteered to participate in an initiative aimed at promoting adult literacy. Working closely with adults who couldn't read or write, I gained insight into the challenges they faced in a literate world. This experience was eye-opening, highlighting the critical importance of education in every individual's life and steering me towards my career path.

## Bachelor's Degree in Mexico

In 2008, I embarked on a journey in Early Childhood Education at the Benemérita y Centenaria Escuela Normal Oficial de Guanajuato. Over these four years, I gained invaluable practical experience in various Guanajuato communities, enhancing my understanding of education's role in shaping social and economic futures. A pivotal experience was my assignment in Calderones, Gto., a remote mountain community accessible only by a perilous dirt road. Despite the challenges of a twice-daily, risky commute on public transport, I was driven by my encounters with resource-deprived schools and the stark need for dedicated educators. This motivated me to commit myself to serving those in the greatest need.

During my final year in the Early Childhood Education program at the Benemérita y Centenaria Escuela Normal Oficial de Guanajuato, my undergraduate thesis focused on the use of experimentation to enhance cognitive abilities like hypothesis formulation and observation in preschool children. This approach was designed to deepen my understanding of child cognitive development, improve the design of activities promoting this development, and analyze and modify my teaching interventions to better support children's cognitive capacities. 

For example, "The Hand That Doesn't Get Wet," was an activity involved preschoolers (around 4 years old) applying talcum powder to their hands and then attempting to retrieve a coin from the bottom of a water-filled container. Initially, the children hypothesized that their hands would get wet, but they were surprised to find their hands stayed dry, thanks to the hydrophobic properties of talcum powder. This experiment introduced basic scientific concepts and encouraged critical thinking.

Another experiment, "Which Egg Spins Faster?", involved spinning a raw egg with a happy face and a boiled egg with a sad face, challenging the children's initial belief that the raw egg would spin faster. This experiment challenged the childrens' assumptions and exposed them to physical concepts like inertia and rotational motion. Through this interactive learning experience, the children were able to grasp the principles of physics in a tangible way, underscoring the importance of experiential learning in early childhood education.

These experiences not only demonstrated the power of inquiry-based learning in early childhood education but also emphasized the importance of hands-on, empirical learning approaches in shaping young minds.

This work significantly contributes to the field of Early Childhood Education by demonstrating the profound impact of experiential learning in developing critical thinking and scientific understanding from a young age.

## Volunteer Experience in USA

After completing my undergrad studies in Early Childhool Education, I moved to Texas in 2013 with a visa that heavily restricted me from working or studying. However, eager to continue learning about early childhood education, I volunteered for a summer school program at an elementary school. My role involved reading books to kindergarten classes. It was during this time that I met a bilingual mathematics specialist who offered me the opportunity to volunteer in her class in the fall semester. There, I worked with small groups of Spanish-speaking kindergarten students struggling with math, tailoring activities to their learning needs to reinforce classroom lessons.

The 2014-2015 academic year brought another opportunity to volunteer, this time at an elementary school in Palo Alto, California. I assisted in three kindergarten classes, one first-grade class, and a second-grade class, all of which were Spanish immersion classes. Additionally, I supervised the playground during recess and accompanied two first-grade and two second-grade classes during their lunchtime. In the 2015-2016 school year, I continued as an assistant in a first-grade class and maintained my supervisory role during recess and lunch.

One of the challenges I set for myself was to identify and help children who were being excluded. My goal was to ensure that these children were included during playtime and that they could confidently interact with other children. I believe I succeeded in building a trusting and friendly relationship with many of the kids, as they would often come up to me during recess to talk about things happening at school and in their everyday lives. This interaction not only fostered a safe and inclusive environment on the playground but also allowed me to understand the dynamics of their relationships and the social challenges they faced, further enriching my experience in early childhood education.

I am commited to enhancing educational opportunities, particularly for communities facing social and economic challenges. My journey from a high school project to volunteering in various educational settings in the United States underscores my passion for and commitment to the field of education.
