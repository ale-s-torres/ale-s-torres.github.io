In 2013, I purchased my first camera, sparking an interest in observing nature, particularly the behaviors of animals. I would sit and attempt to photograph the unique personalities and attitudes of each species I encountered in my daily life, particularly birds.

Later, in 2014, my intrigue extended to the intricate interactions between plants and insects. I decided to challenge myself with macro photography â€” a form I found to be the most difficult due to variables such as the rapid movement of plant parts and insects, sometimes due to unavoidable elements like wind.

Portrait photography has been a more personal endeavor, practiced within my close circle, including my family and children I have met in schools where I've worked. These portraits have been a way to document significant and personal moments. Although it's currently a personal passion, I aspire to pursue it professionally one day.
