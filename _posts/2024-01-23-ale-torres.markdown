I have dedicated my career to fostering learning in various capacities. 
I honed my skills in Early Childhood Education at the Benem√©rita y Centenaria
Escuela Normal Oficial de Guanajuato, where I embraced the power of inquiry-based 
learning and the importance of hands-on experiences, as evidenced by my innovative 
thesis projects. Moving to the USA in 2013, my passion led me to volunteer in summer 
school programs and Spanish immersion classes in California, with a focus on creating
inclusive play environments and building trust with children, allowing me to gain deep 
insights into the social dynamics and challenges within educational settings. Alongside
my educational pursuits, I've cultivated a passion for photography, capturing the essence
of nature, the delicate dance between flora and insects, and the unspoken stories in the
portraits of those around me. My website reflects this rich tapestry of experiences, 
showcasing my commitment to enriching education and my aspiration to one day professionalize
my talent in photography.
